tf101g with 3g for cyanogenmod.
This _not_ an official port.

Here are the major issues :

 * After a reboot, the sim card is locked. You need to shutdown the tablet to
reset it.
 * GSM works with a nasty hack based on setuid. I tried to document it in the
file prebuilt/gsm.
 * The OTA file is forced as "tf101" to make CWM happy


To use it, clone this repo in device/asus and add :
  add_lunch_combo cm_tf101g-userdebug
in vendor/cm/vendorsetup.sh
